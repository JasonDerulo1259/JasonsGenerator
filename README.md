# NumberPrinter-RandEvenConsecOdd
A Basic Number Printer, Useful for generating passwords, keys, sequences of numbers, and more.

## Installation
[Download and setup python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you haven't already.

Then, after [downloading the newest release](https://github.com/JasonDerulo1259/NumberPrinter-RandEvenConsecOdd/releases) of the number printer, follow the instructions on the program. (explained below)

## Usage
The first thing you see when you open the python program (assuming it was installed correctly) is something similar to this
(screenshot taken on version 0.3)

This is where you can choose what to output.

The current options are Even numbers, Odd numbers, Consecutive numbers, Random numbers, non repeating password and repeating password.

To choose one you put in the letter that corresponds to it.
```python
e="Even", o="Odd", c="Consecutive", r="Random", p="Password (without repeating)", pr="Password (with repeating)"
```
Next, It will ask you how many times/strings to print. [image here](https://i.imgur.com/rIYxWV5.png)

Here, Just input any number you want, and it will print that many strings of It

For example. If you chose consecutive, And put `25`, 
It would print something similar to this **depending on the settings chosen after this point**

Anyway, After it asks you what the amount you want to print out is, It will then show output another option, that says [this](https://i.imgur.com/nWjp7WY.png)

`What speed should it print`
And it will go on to tell you to answer in seconds. And that 0.02 is a "Normal-ish" Speed.

This is where you choose the time between each string. 

The example below compares printing 100 numbers at 0.02 compared to 1
